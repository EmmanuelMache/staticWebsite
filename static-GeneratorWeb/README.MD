This is a simple stsic-generator site
I used an example from Cloud Academy
Some of the codes I created using ChatGpt
changed a code in the css file a code removes the vendor prefixes for the transition property, since they're no longer necessary for modern browsers. It also removes the redundant ease-in-out values for the transition property, since that's the default timing function
Other changes I made include:
  Consolidated multiple properties in the label rule into a single font property.
  Removed redundant vendor prefixes in the input/select/textarea rule.
  Removed some unnecessary properties, such as line-height in the label rule.
  Removed some unnecessary values, such as block and 0 in the display and margin properties of the input/select/textarea rule.
  Combined the transition properties for input/select/textarea into a single line.
  Consolidated the :focus rule for input/select/textarea into a single block.
 Removed the default box-shadow for invalid form elements and instead used none.# static-website
